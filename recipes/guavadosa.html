        <p><h6>Guava and Cream Cheese Dosa made on the stove</h6></p>
        <p><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3></p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Sesame Oil</li>
                 <li>Premade Dosa Batter (<em>If you would like to make your own you can find recipes online</em>)</li>
                 <li>Spreadable Cream Cheese</li>
                 <li>Guava paste</li>
             </ul>
                
        <p><h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a cast iron tawa (skillet) to medium heat</li>
            <li>Drop 1/4 tsp of seasame oil on the hot skillet and spread around using a paper towel to cover the entire tawa</li>
            <li>Using a steel bottom cup or steel ladle, pour 1 cup of the dosa batter on the tawa and spread in a circular motion to make a thin pancake like shape</li>
            <li>Let the dosa cook until you see brown coming through on the dosa. This only takes about 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li> Once you see brown coming through, spread cream cheese on the dosa and then slices of guava paste on top. (Is it up to you how much you would like.  I ususally use 3 or 4 slices</li>
            <li>Using a steel spatula, fold the dosa 3 times to make a nice crepe like roll</li>
            <li>Flip the dosa over to get a nice crisp on the seal</li>
            <li>Using the spatula, cut the dosa in half to make 2 halves</li>
            <li>Serve Hot!</li>

        </ol>
