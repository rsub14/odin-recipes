        <p><h6>Vegetable Upma (made with peas and carrots) and Coconut Chutney</h6></p>
        <p><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Vegetable Upma</strong></h4></p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Neutral Cooking Oil (I use avocado oil but vegetable or canola oil would work</li>
                 <li>1/2 tsp mustard seeds</li>
                 <li>1/2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
                 <li>1 tsp urad dal</li>
                 <li>1 small onion diced</li>
                 <li>1 tsp green chili</li>
                 <li>1/2 inch of ginger</li>
                 <li>1 cup of any diced vegetables you'd like!</li>
                 <li>1 cup rava (semolina)</li>
                 <li>2 cups water</li>
                 <li>Salt to taste</li>
             </ul>
             <p><h4><strong>Coconut Chutney</strong></h4></p>
             <ul>
                 <li>1/2 cup grated or chopped coconut</li>
                 <li>1 tbsp green chili</li>
                 <li>1 tbsp chana or urad dal</li>
                 <li>1 tsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
                 <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
                 <li>1/2 of water (add a tbsp of water at a time if needed</li>
                 <li>Salt to taste</li>
             </ul>
                
        <p><h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large sauce pan over medium heat and add the oil and mustard seeds and cumin seeds until they sputter. Do not over cook because the mastard seeds can cause some irritation in your throat</li>
            <li>Once seeds sputter, add the chana dal.  Cook until roasted through</li>
            <li>Add diced onion and cook until translucent but not carmelized </li>
            <li>Add chili and ginger until fragrant</li>
            <li>Add the vegetables you're choosing to put in the upma and cook all the way through</li>
            <li>Mix in the cup of rava until well incorporated into the vegetables</li>
            <li>Slowly add the water while mixing it into the rava.  The rava will cook quickly so continuously stir to avoid getting large clumps</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium-low and keep stirring until all the ingredients are well mixed.  Taste and add salt as needed</li>
            <li>Place all the ingredients for the coconut chutney in a blender and blend until moist but still thick</li>
            <li>Serve upma warmed with cool coconut chutney</li>

        </ol>
